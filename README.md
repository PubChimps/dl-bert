# dlfBERT

A roBERTa-like classifier trained on sequence classification to differentiate between tenosorflow and pytorch code. Try it for yourself with [testdlfBERT.ipynb](https://github.com/PubChimps/dlfBERT/blob/master/testdlfBERT.ipynb) or on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/PubChimps/dlfBERT)

Model is finetuned from Hugging Face's CodeBERTa-small-v1 programming language classifier on 12,000+ examples of tensorflow and pytorch code, hosted on Box [here](https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/4x5bqo41yuwvvnce1tkx051khi726f11.npy
).
